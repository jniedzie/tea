Histogramming is a process of turning ROOT trees into 1D/2D histograms. You can apply histogramming to your input samples or samples that already pass some [skimming]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/skimming/) (could be multiple levels of skimming).

If you want to generate histograms of branches that already exist in your input tree, have a look at [My first histogrammer]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/my_first_histogrammer/) tutorial.

When this is not enough and you want to create some custom variables + perhaps apply some cuts on-the-fly, you should refer to the [Custom histogrammer]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/custom_histogrammer/) tutorial page.
