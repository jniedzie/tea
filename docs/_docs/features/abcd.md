ABCD is one of the most popular ways to estimate background in searches for BSM physics. You can find a description of the method on this [CMS EXO Methods Forum page](https://exo-methods-forum.docs.cern.ch/background_estimation_techniques/abcd/). This page will describe some tools in `tea` that will help you optimize and apply the ABCD method.
