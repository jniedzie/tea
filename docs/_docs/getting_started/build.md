Building `tea` together with your analysis files is very straighforward. Simply source the build script:

```
source build.sh
```

Once compiled, you can go to `bin` directory and execute any of the apps directly from there (all configs will also be installed in this directory), e.g.: 

```bash
./skimmer skimmer_config.py
```
