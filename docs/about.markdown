TEA stands for Toolkit for Efficient Analysis. It is a set of loop-based tools built in C++ and Python, which will help you with:

reading any kind of flat ntuples stored in ROOT files (e.g. NanoAOD or HEPMC converted to ROOT),
applying selections,
saving skimmed trees,
creating cut flow tables,
creating histograms,
plotting histograms.
Upcoming features:

submission to HTCondor based grid systems (e.g. lxplus or NAF),
optimization and verification of ABCD method for background estimation,
estimation of systematic uncertainties,
applying correction (e.g. Jet Energy Corrections, Jet Energy Resolution, Pile-Up reweighting, etc.),
calculating limits with Combine,
...
For these instructions we will use a scenario in which you start working on a ttH analysis.
